			<b>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee</b>
			(born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the
			<b>
				<i>World Wide Web</i>
			</b>. He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989, and he implemented the first successful
			communication
			between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet sometime around mid-November of that
			same
			year.
			<br>
			<br> Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of
			the Web.
			He is also the founder of the World Wide Web Foundation, and is a senior researcher and holder of the founders chair
			at
			the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). He is a director of the Web Science
			Research
			Initiative (WSRI), and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In 2011, he was
			named
			as a member the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation.
			<br>
			<br> In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work. In April 2009, he was elected
			a foreign
			associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences. Named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important
			People
			of the 20th century, Berners-Lee has received a number of other accolades for his invention. He was honoured as the
			"Inventor
			of the World Wide Web" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared in person, working
			with
			a vintage NeXT Computer at the London Olympic Stadium. He tweeted "This is for everyone", which instantly was
			spelled
			out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80,000 people in the audience.

		<b>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee</b>
		(born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the
		<b>
			<i>World Wide Web</i>
		</b>. He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989, and he implemented the first successful communication
		between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet sometime around mid-November of that same
		year.
		<br>
		<br> Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web.
		He is also the founder of the World Wide Web Foundation, and is a senior researcher and holder of the founders chair at
		the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative
		(WSRI), and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In 2011, he was named as a member
		the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation.

		<br> In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work. In April 2009, he was elected a foreign
		associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences. Named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People
		of the 20th century, Berners-Lee has received a number of other accolades for his invention. He was honoured as the "Inventor
		of the World Wide Web" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared in person, working with a
